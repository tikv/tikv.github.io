initSidebarItems({"fn":[["copy_and_sync","Copies the source file to a newly created file."],["prepare_sst_for_ingestion","Prepares the SST file for ingestion. The purpose is to make the ingestion retryable when using the `move_files` option. Things we need to consider here: 1. We need to access the original file on retry, so we should make a clone    before ingestion. 2. `RocksDB` will modified the global seqno of the ingested file, so we need    to modified the global seqno back to 0 so that we can pass the checksum    validation. 3. If the file has been ingested to `RocksDB`, we should not modified the    global seqno directly, because that may corrupt RocksDB's data."]]});
